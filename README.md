# programming language

I have at least 4 projects which I'm working on so why not add a 5th which I know I won't finish because I'm lazy and I'm not smart enough :D. But in all seriousness I wanted to get into some advanced programming projects, mainly in systems engineering, to beef up my portfolio, and wanted an excuse to use rust so I'm working on an [implementation of a neural network from scratch](https://github.com/thereal-atom/neural-network-implementation) and now this.

I hope this will teach me about a lot of fundemental programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, system architecture, memory management, low level computing and more. Along with this I want to, of course, gain knowledge of rust and general lower level programming.

I will most likely not be using this language for any practical projects but I hope it would impress my classmates who struggle to write loops and functions in python. Most of all I think this will be a fun project!
